lab04.py - permafrost melting

This lab explores how forward differencing methdos can be used
to solve the heat equation with time in 1 dimension. We use this
heat diffusion equation model to answer questions about the seasonal
dynamics of permafrost and the impact of warming on permafrost in
the future.

To execute the code in this lab simply run:
```
    python lab04.py
```

The simulation should produce 9 figures - a heatmap and vertical
temperature profile for the baseline climate and the 0.5, 1 and 3
degree warming scenarios, and an ensemble plot showing all temperature
profiles on a single map.

Logging is used for the purpose of debugging, and will log to the terminal
based on the logging level defined in the heatdiff function. Otherwise,
logger messages will only be written for warnings and errors.

in your terminal. Because a main() function is used, the code should
execute immediately and generate all the figures necessary to replicate
those shown in the lab report. This will also run the unit test written
to satisfy the requirements in question 1.

If a directory is not supplied in the
OUTPATH global variable as user input, the figures in the lab will
save in a new directory created in your current working directory.
